                About Me
            </h2>
            <p className="center">
                Hello! My name is Alaina Sang.
                <br />
                I am a freelance illustrator who loves to paint cute animals with vibrant colors. I prefer to work with fantasy and magical realism themes. 
            </p>
            <p className="center">
                I graduated with a BFA in Painting with a focus on oils and a minor in Biology from the University of Denver, with the intent of pursuing scientific illustration. Over time, my work has led me to the video game industry instead, with a focus on concept art and assets.
            </p>
            <p className="center">
            I specialize in both traditional and digital illustration and many stages of the gamedev pipeline. Specific programs with which I have experience include Photoshop, Illustrator, Spine, and Animate. Traditional media include inks, watercolor, and oil.
            </p>
